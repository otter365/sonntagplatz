            <h2>CI/CD for Product Managers: Getting Your Hands Dirty</h2>
            
            <div class="post-body">
                <p>I just deployed a professional <strong>"Digital Square"</strong> with a setup that many mid-level developers would envy. Most PMs talk about pipelines in high-level roadmap meetings, but few actually step into the engine room to build one.</p>

                <p>By connecting <strong>VS Code</strong> to <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong>, I’ve established a seamless CI/CD Pipeline. This means the friction between an idea and a live URL has been reduced to zero.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "I am now the master of my own content with $0 overhead. By using the same tools as the engineering teams I lead, I’ve reclaimed the ability to iterate at the speed of thought."
                </blockquote>

                <p>From now on, this space will serve as the technical documentation for my builds—proving that a Product Manager's greatest asset isn't just a spreadsheet, but the ability to execute on the metal.</p>
